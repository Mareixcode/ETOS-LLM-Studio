## 👋 Foreword

School life can be pretty boring, and I always seem to have a lot of things I want to ask AI. At the time, most AI apps on the App Store were either absurdly expensive or too limited to be useful—especially on Apple Watch—so I ended up building one myself.

What started as a rough little app with only 1,800 lines of code and hardcoded API keys has grown into a project with **758 Swift source files and 284,139 lines of Swift code** (project Swift only; the llama.cpp submodule and VitePress doc-site dependencies are not included). “ETOS LLM Studio” may sound a bit over the top, but in reality it is still my playground for exploring the boundaries of LLM applications.

It is no longer just a Watch app either. I have gradually expanded the iOS side into a complete experience for managing cloud models, local GGUF weights, tools, memory, worldbooks, and Daily Pulse, and the two platforms stay in sync through the built-in sync engine.

Since I mostly use a Mac and an Apple Watch in daily life, the iPhone side still has some edges I want to polish—but I will keep improving it.

### Key Features

#### Chat and Models

*   **Native on Both Platforms**: Built natively for iOS and Apple Watch, with a consistent visual language and platform-specific interaction tuning. On iOS, the session list uses a card-style layout with clear folder/session grouping, and switches to a fixed dual-column sidebar in landscape.
*   **Session Management Enhancements**: Supports full-text session search, in-context match preview, message-index jump, folder classification, Finder-style color tags, quick filtering, nested moves, batch operations, a full-screen session management entry, per-session cross-device send, and infinite-scroll history loading.
*   **Multi-Model Support**: Native adapters for OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic (Claude), and Google (Gemini), with in-app provider/model management, model-list fetching, and long-press drag ordering for providers.
*   **On-Device Local Models**: Imports GGUF weights as a “Local Models” provider, executed through a llama.cpp C ABI bridge. It supports streaming output, GGUF Jinja chat templates, local tool-call parsing, reasoning-content parsing, local embedding-model routing, and detached background completion.
*   **Advanced Local Model Tuning**: Each GGUF weight can override context size, output limit, GPU layers, batch / ubatch, KV offload, flash attention, seed, sampler chain, grammar, repetition penalties, chat-template passthrough, and more. Common llama.cpp-style CLI parameter import, model-cache control, and iOS high-memory entitlement support are also included.
*   **Advanced Request Configuration**: Supports custom headers, parameter expressions, structured request controls, key/value payload editing, raw JSON request bodies, and request preview for experimental or provider-compatible setups.
*   **Message Regex Rules**: Supports rule-based rewriting of outgoing and incoming messages, manageable as multiple rules from the preferences and quickly reachable from the provider page.
*   **Single Assistant Reply Rewrite**: Lets you rewrite one historical assistant reply in place, optionally referencing other versions of the same message, without rerunning the whole conversation.
*   **Model Pricing and Cost Estimation**: Lets you configure per-model local prices (including tiered price ranges) and automatically estimates the cost of each message based on token usage.
*   **Multimodal and Image Generation**: Supports voice, image, and file attachments; images can go through a dedicated OCR channel, file attachments are textified before sending, and image generation has been consolidated into the assistant image gallery.
*   **Conversation Import/Export**: Supports importing from ETOS / `.elsbackup`, Cherry Studio, RikkaHub, Kelivo, ChatBox, and ChatGPT conversations, plus export to PDF / Markdown / TXT.
*   **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Integrates system `SFSpeechRecognizer` streaming transcription. The iOS / watchOS recording flow now lives inside the chat composer, with real-time transcription, direct-audio sending, and transcript insertion.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Supports system TTS, cloud TTS, and automatic fallback, with separate model and playback parameter settings.
*   **Concurrent Session Requests**: Each session keeps its own request state, with per-session cancellation, background-completion notifications, and tap-to-jump back to the originating chat.

#### Display and Reading Experience

*   **Customizable Display System**: Supports custom fonts (including WOFF / WOFF2), font scale, font-slot priority, bubble/text color customization, chat color profiles, time-based color switching, and a bubbleless assistant UI.
*   **Local Performance Monitor**: On iOS, local-model chats can show CPU, Metal, and memory usage above the composer. The panel supports collapsing, dragging, touch passthrough, and position persistence.
*   **Bubble Toolbar**: A configurable toolbar can be attached below each chat bubble — single-row horizontal scroll, optional outer border, separate default items for iOS and watchOS per user/assistant role, and drag-to-reorder on watchOS.
*   **Font Fallback Strategy**: Supports paragraph-level and glyph-level fallback scope selection for more stable mixed-language and symbol rendering.
*   **Thinking and Tool Timeline**: Includes rolling thinking preview, custom/responsive preview height, hidden full reasoning while streaming, thinking-time tracking, asynchronous thinking summaries, tool-call connected timeline, error-retry resumption, and multi-version reply switching. Tool approval has been redesigned as a native Q&A sheet with row/column option layout.
*   **Markdown and Code Block Enhancements**: Supports syntax highlighting, copy feedback, collapse toggle, iOS code preview, Mermaid rendering, SwiftMath formulas, blockquote left-border styling, streaming tail fade-in, and shimmer animation.
*   **watchOS Image Reading**: Markdown images and generated images support Digital Crown zoom and drag, so even small screens are good for actually looking at images.

#### Tools and Automation

*   **Tool Center + Extended Tools**: Unified management for MCP, Shortcuts, built-in local tools, custom JavaScript tools, Agent Skills, and built-in tools like `getSystemTime`, grouped by source and use case with toggles, approval policies, session-level enablement, categorization, and tool detail pages.
*   **Agent Skills Packages**: Supports importing skill bundles from local folders, GitHub repository links, GitHub raw / nested directories, default branches, and hidden directories. Skill resources support text-encoding reads, large-file chunking, document text extraction, and image OCR; skill metadata is exposed to the model for on-demand activation.
*   **Structured Q&A Tool (`ask_user_input`)**: Supports step-by-step single-question flow, single/multi choice exclusivity rules, custom input, and previous-question navigation.
*   **Custom JavaScript Tools**: Supports separated JS execution and AI-created script tools. Scripts live in a dedicated `CustomJSTools` directory, are validated before creation, and can be enabled, disabled, and assigned approval policies like regular tools.
*   **Extended Tooling Coverage**: Adds built-in system time, SQLite CRUD tools, web card display, input-box filling, sandbox file operations, and automatic feedback ticket submission.
*   **Sandbox File System Tools**: Supports search, chunked reading, diff viewing, partial edits, move / copy / delete, and other file operations.
*   **MCP Integration**: Built on the official Swift [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) SDK, with streamable HTTP / SSE transport, reconnect handling, timeouts, handshake governance, metadata refresh, resource/template/prompt reads, and capability negotiation. Supports server drag ordering, tool-level enablement/approval policies, built-in server deletion and restore, and deferred auto-connect per chat-exposure toggle.
*   **Built-in MCP Servers**: Includes built-in search, local app tools, and personal-data MCP servers. The personal-data server requests HealthKit, Calendar, and Reminders permissions only when a tool is actually invoked.
*   **Siri Shortcuts**: Integrates with the Shortcuts framework, supports AI invocation through shortcuts, custom tools, and URL Scheme routing.
*   **In-App File Management**: Includes a built-in file manager for browsing and managing sandbox files directly inside the app, with inline preview for plain-text files.

#### Memory and Knowledge Organization

*   **Local RAG Memory**: Embeddings can use cloud APIs or registered local embedding models, while the **vector database itself runs fully locally on SQLite**. Also supports chunking, embedding progress visualization, memory editing, per-memory re-embedding, retrieval timestamp controls, and active retrieval tools.
*   **GRDB Relational Persistence**: Core persistence migrated from JSON to GRDB + SQLite, covering sessions, configuration, MCP, worldbooks, memory, feedback, shortcuts, usage analytics, and global prompts; SQLCipher full-disk physical encryption can be turned on as a base layer.
*   **Worldbook**: A Lorebook-style system similar to SillyTavern, with background setting management, conditional triggers, session-bound isolation, system injection, and URL import. SillyTavern compatibility has been further improved for multi-book injection, injection-budget control, and field isolation.
*   **Broad Format Compatibility**: Compatible with PNG naidata, top-level JSON arrays, and `character_book` worldbook formats.
*   **Request Logs and Speed Insights**: Includes independent request logs, payload detail pages, an optional toggle for plain-text request message logging, detailed token summaries, and streaming-response speed charts.
*   **Usage Analytics**: Tracks text requests, model rankings, tokens, and cached tokens. Provides iOS/watchOS dashboards, a green heatmap, cache-hit rate, and cross-device sync; today's trend is split by hour, and per-model token trend charts, share analysis, and an all-time range are available.
*   **Advanced Rendering**: Built-in Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, tables, and LaTeX math support.

#### Daily Pulse Proactive Briefing

*   **Daily Pulse**: Generates proactive cards every day so the app can surface what might be worth your attention before you even ask.
*   **Pulse Task Workflow**: Cards can be turned into follow-up tasks. Incomplete tasks persist across days and feed into the next Pulse run.
*   **Feedback History Learning**: Likes, downranks, hides, and saves become long-term preference signals that keep shaping future results.
*   **Morning Reminders and Continue Chat**: Supports scheduled reminders, notification quick actions, saving cards as sessions, and continuing into chat flows on both iOS and watchOS.

#### Security, Sync, and Operations

*   **App Lock**: Two-factor protection backed by a Keychain-stored PBKDF2 master password and biometrics (Face ID / Touch ID); supports verifying the old password when changing it and auto-presenting the unlock screen on lock. Available on both iOS and watchOS.
*   **Full-Disk Database Encryption**: SQLCipher applies physical-layer encryption to the core SQLite databases, with encrypted migration, new-password verification, and reads from encrypted side-databases. The in-app file browser and debug tools are fully compatible.
*   **Snapshot Backup and Encryption**: Builds offline database snapshots through the SQLite Online Backup API (with FTS stripping), supports a full snapshot mode, and offers dual-mode AES-256-GCM encryption (simple password / PBKDF2), along with binary `.elsbackup` upload and a secure restore flow.
*   **Cross-Device Sync**: A built-in iOS ↔ watchOS sync engine that automatically syncs provider config, sessions, session tags, worldbooks, tool settings, Daily Pulse, usage analytics, user profile, global prompts, and more. Supports Manifest/Delta differential sync, a WatchConnectivity fast channel, iCloud roaming sync, offline session-fork isolation, and merging of retry-version history for the same message.
*   **Multi-Channel Cloud Backup**: Supports ETOS package export/import, `.elsbackup` snapshot import, full import on watchOS, CloudKit transport (including APNs silent push to trigger background sync), iCloud Drive backup export/import, startup backup with corruption self-healing, and signed snapshot uploads to S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2), remote snapshot browsing, plus restore by downloading from the cloud.
*   **AppConfigStore Configuration Hub**: Fully replaces `@AppStorage`; every runtime setting goes through GRDB persistence with a runtime read cache and background async writes dispatched back to the main thread, avoiding main-thread I/O and multi-device config drift. A one-time migration from legacy UserDefaults is included.
*   **Update Timeline**: A back-end-free version tracking system that rebuilds the release timeline locally from build info and cache, with AI summaries rendered as Markdown — iOS shows it in batches, watchOS splits it into a second-level browser.
*   **In-App Feedback Assistant**: Supports feedback categories, environment collection, Git commit hash, PoW submission flow, in-ticket comments, jumping from referenced commits into the update timeline, distribution-channel display, and cross-device sync.
*   **Network Proxy Support**: Supports global and provider-level HTTP(S)/SOCKS proxy with authentication.
*   **Feedback Center and Notifications**: Supports in-ticket comments, developer badge display, status auto-refresh, and high-priority local notifications with deep links.
*   **LAN Debugging**: Includes a LAN debugging client, a Go-based TUI debugging tool, and a built-in web console; supports Bonjour discovery, file / SQLite / Provider / advanced model configuration / MCP management, app configuration editing, and OpenAI request capture.
*   **Doc Site**: A new VitePress documentation site covering installation, first chat, provider setup, UI tours, module references, design docs, and usage tips.
*   **Localization**: Supports 8 languages — English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong), Japanese, Russian, French, Spanish, and Arabic, with in-app language switching.

## 💸 About Pricing and Open Source

To be honest, I originally wanted to make this free software.
But the Apple Developer Program costs $99 per year, which is not exactly light for a student.

Later, an investor helped cover that fee, on the condition that I repay it through software sales (and share revenue along the way). So the App Store version charges a symbolic amount. You can think of it as helping me pay off that cost while also buying the convenience of “not having to re-sign every seven days.”

**But open source is still my bottom line.**

So the rules are simple:
1.  **If you want convenience / want to support me**: See you on the App Store, and thank you for the “Coke money.”
2.  **If you want to tinker / want it for free**: The code is right here under GPLv3. If you have a Mac and Xcode, **you can build and install it yourself with no feature differences at all**.
3.  **If you want the latest build early**: Join TestFlight 👉 [https://testflight.apple.com/join/d4PgF4CK](https://testflight.apple.com/join/d4PgF4CK)

Technology should be shared. I do not want a small price barrier to block someone who is just as curious about code as I am.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project uses a two-layer structure: a platform-independent ETOSCore framework plus platform-specific view layers. The latest round of refactoring introduced the `Config/AppConfigStore` configuration hub, fully replaced `@AppStorage`, and added `LocalLLM` / `LocalLLMBridge` to route on-device GGUF inference into the existing chat lifecycle. MCP, sync/import, LAN debugging, and session tags have also been split into dedicated modules. The largest single Swift file is about 1,540 lines (`Sync/WatchSyncManager.swift`); local model management, the sync engine, and Tool Center remain heavier modules to keep trimming over time.

## 🚀 Build Guide

If you want to build it yourself:

1.  **Clone the project and submodules**:
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Eric-Terminal/ETOS-LLM-Studio.git
    cd ETOS-LLM-Studio
    ```
2.  **Requirements**:
    *   Xcode 26.0+
    *   watchOS 26.0+ SDK
    *   CMake + Ninja (if missing, run `brew install cmake ninja`)
    *   (If your environment does not match exactly, you can adjust compatibility yourself.)
3.  **First build step: generate the llama.cpp static library**:
    Xcode no longer rebuilds llama.cpp during every app build. ETOSCore links against the prebuilt `libetos-llama.a`. For device / Release builds, run:
    ```bash
    CONFIGURATION=Release SDK_NAME=iphoneos PLATFORM_NAME=iphoneos ARCHS=arm64 scripts/build-llama-static-library.sh --parallel
    CONFIGURATION=Release SDK_NAME=watchos PLATFORM_NAME=watchos ARCHS="arm64 arm64_32" scripts/build-llama-static-library.sh --parallel
    ```
    For local Debug simulator builds, use:
    ```bash
    CONFIGURATION=Debug SDK_NAME=iphonesimulator PLATFORM_NAME=iphonesimulator ARCHS=arm64 scripts/build-llama-static-library.sh --parallel
    CONFIGURATION=Debug SDK_NAME=watchsimulator PLATFORM_NAME=watchsimulator ARCHS=arm64 scripts/build-llama-static-library.sh --parallel
    ```
    The output is written to `Dependencies/llama-build/products/<platform>-<configuration>/libetos-llama.a`. The script uses Ninja as the CMake generator; Ninja parallelizes builds by default, and `--parallel` explicitly passes the local CPU count to CMake. You can also use `--parallel=8`, `--jobs 8`, or `-j8` to choose a task count. The script uses a stamp file to skip unnecessary rebuilds and cleans intermediate build directories after producing the final library. If Xcode reports `library 'etos-llama' not found`, `file not found: libetos-llama.a`, or missing llama.cpp symbols, rerun the matching command for the current SDK / Configuration.
4.  **Open the project**:
    Open `ETOS LLM Studio.xcworkspace` (**workspace**, not xcodeproj).
    On first launch, Xcode will automatically resolve and fetch Swift Package dependencies.
5.  **Run**:
    Select the `ETOS LLM Studio App` scheme to run the iOS app; choose the `ETOS LLM Studio Watch App` scheme only when debugging watchOS directly. Connect a device (or simulator), then press Command + R.
6.  **Configure**:
    After launching, add your API key in Settings. I strongly recommend using the “LAN Debugging” feature to push prepared JSON configuration files straight into `Documents/Providers/` (because who really wants to type an API key on an Apple Watch?).
